      My name is Abdullah but my friends call me abudi. I started 
      programming in the middle of the pandemic learning from hindu Udemy tutorials.
      nowadays i offer<strong
        > tech solutions to businesses and companies </strong
      >with the best code practices and design principles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of my achievements include <strong
        >migrating all the obsolete systems
        in the PDVSA subsidiary, VASSA</strong
      >. Currently the company benefits from faster data processes by 70% and
      a modernization of their systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have experience in diverse technologies such as <strong>React, 
        Angular, Next.js, Django, Flask</strong>. However, I am always
        looking to learn new technologies and adapt to the needs of the
        companies I work with.
