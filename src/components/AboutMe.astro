      I'm Abdullah but almost everyone calls me Abdul. I started 
      programming since 2016 and the moment programming just clicked with me, i just fell in love.
      nowadays i offer<strong
        > modern robust tech solutions to businesses and companies </strong
      >with the best code practices and design principles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of my achievements include <strong
        >replacing all the obsolete systems
        in the PDVSA subsidiary, VASSA</strong
      >. Currently the company benefits from faster data processes by 70% and
      a modernization of their systems.

      I have experience in diverse technologies such as <strong>Python, Django, FastAPI,
        SQL, AWS, React, Typescript, Next.js</strong>. Also deep knowledge with DevOps
        practices such as IaC, Terraform, CI/CD, Kubernetes and Docker. However, I am always
        looking to learn new technologies and adapt to the needs of the
        companies I work with.
